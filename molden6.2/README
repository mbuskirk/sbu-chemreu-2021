To retrieve molden source code:

ftp ftp.cmbi.kun.nl
Name: anonymous
Passord: your_email_address
ftp> binary
ftp> cd /pub/molgraph/molden
ftp> get molden3.7.tar.Z
ftp> quit

To build molden:

uncompress molden3.7.tar.Z
tar -xvf molden3.7.tar
cd molden3.6

# edit the makefile, activate the lines for your platform, deactivate
# silicon graphics

make >& make.log &

To build the opengl molden helper program (You may not have opengl support
on your system):

make moldenogl

To get ready to run executables for your platform (example for linux):

ftp ftp.cmbi.kun.nl
Name: anonymous
Passord: your_email_address
ftp> binary
ftp> cd /pub/molgraph/molden/bin
ftp> get molden3.7.linux
ftp> get moldenogl.linux
ftp> quit

molden3.7.linux is the molden executable and moldenogl.linux is the
molden opengl helper program.

Now move the molden executable to a directory that is in your search path,
say /usr/local/bin and call it molden.exe:

mv molden3.7.linux /usr/local/bin/molden.exe
mv moldenogl.linux /usr/local/bin/moldenogl

The proper setup of molden is to call a wrapper program of molden which
sets up the environment variables for the external program such as,
gamess, gaussian, mopac and tinker.

cat <<EOF > /usr/local/bin/molden
#!/bin/csh
#
setenv TA_ROOT /compchem/1/sybyl64
setenv TNK_ROOT /compchem/1/tinker
setenv MOPAC_ROOT /compchem/1/mopac93
setenv GAMESS_ROOT /compchem/1/gamess
setenv g98root /compchem/2
#
/usr/local/bin/molden.exe $argv
#
EOF

# remember to deactivate the external programs you dont have by putting
# a # in front of its line, make this file executable

chmod ugo+rx /usr/local/bin/molden

To run molden simply type:

molden

Or:

molden file1 file2 .. filen


The example is for linux, but there are many more unix platforms
and also windowsNT/windows95 and freebsd (molden_windows_nt_95.zip
and molden3.6-freebsd, moldenogl-freebsd)


NOTE: you will need to update the molden OpenGL helper program
      simultaneously with the upgrade from molden3.6 to molden3.7
