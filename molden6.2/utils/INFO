	colors		Tobe evoked with the -r commandline flag:
			
			molden -r colors

			See molden -h for how it works

	molden		This file is a wrapper around the real molden
			executable, it defines where auxilliary packages
			can be found, such as gamess,gaussian,mopac,tinker
			Deactivate the lines for the packages you dont have
			and adjust the absolute path to molden.exe.
			These packages are fired from the Z-matrix editor
			gamess,gaussian,mopac via the "submit job" button,
			tinker,sybyl via the "map xyz/optimise" button.

	ircextract.awk
			This will extract only optimised structures from
			a Gaussian IRC calculation, usage:

			awk -f ircextract.awk output.g98 > output.irc

			You can read output.irc back into molden and view
			it with the 'movie' and 'next' button.
